# E-POWER : Optimal Deployment of Electric Vehicles & Charging Stations

# MICRON SMAI HACK 2022 National Finalists
E-POWER is an optimization tool to choose the optimal location for EVs Charging Stations. And help owners to reach Charging Stations and mingle with eco-friendly world

Take all points of interest (Petrol pumps, CNG stations, parking lots, shopping complexes, etc)
Take petrol pumps & CNG stations separately as 1 subset and the rest as another subset separately.

At least 1 EV charger for a R radius area must be present at petrol/CNG pumps.                R determined with statistical analysis model.
From petrol pumps, we determine which to make EV charger based on statistical analysis and optimization(using various parameters)
For parking lots etc. we will use the same methodology to get the priority of where to install EV charger first.
